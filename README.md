# Javascript Chrome Extension

## Description

A Google Chrome extension developed in Javascript that allows the user to save links that they may want to revisit later. You can save the current tab and later open it on a new tab. I built this app following a tutorial by Per Herald Borgen in Scrimba

## Lessons learned
These are some of the key JS concepts I learnt while building this application:

* Using EventListener on JS
* Inner HTML to manipulate HTML elements in DOM
* Getting value from the input field
* Using template strings
* LocalStorage
  
## How to use

1. Download the zipped file and unzip it

2. On Google Chrome, type: _chrome://extensions_ 

3. On the tab, turn on developer mode

5. This should install the Leads Tracker Chrome extension

6. Find it at the extensions tab - it appears as a dollar sign
